Work / rest timer running in venv.
Some might actually call it "Happy-wife-happy-life-timer"
 
To run:
source venv/bin/activate to activate venv
make sure pygame is installed
run main.py

Program description:
After each 30 min work interval a short break will come.
While its not really a break, but more of "remember to do shit around the house"-break
The program will suggest some small things to do, like "taking out the trash" or "cleaning the kitchen"
After every 4th work interval you'll get a longer break (15min). This is more of a real break or a 
reward interval.
